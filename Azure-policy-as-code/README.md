## Getting Support

The general Azure Policy support role of this repository has transitioned to standard Azure support channels. See below for information about getting support help for Azure Policy.

### Alias Requests

An alias enables you to restrict what values or conditions are permitted for a *property* on a resource. Each alias maps to the paths in different API versions for a given resource type. During policy evaluation, the policy engine gets the property path for that API version.
See the documentation page on aliases [**here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#aliases). For additional information about Azure Policy and aliases, visit this [**blog post**](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/more-resource-policy-aliases/).

Previously, this repository was the official channel to open requests for new aliases. Since the full set of aliases for most namespaces have now been published, support for requesting aliases is now handled by Azure Customer Support. Open a new [**Azure Customer Support ticket**](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) if you believe you need new aliases to be published.

[**This page**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure#aliases) documents the commands for discovering existing aliases.

### General Questions

## Known Issues

Azure Policy operates at a level above other Azure services by applying policy rules against PUT requests and GET responses of resource types going between Azure Resource Manager and the owning resource provider (RP). In a few cases, the behavior of a given RP is unexpected or incompatible in some way with Azure Policy. The Azure Policy team works with the RP teams to close these gaps as soon as possible after they are discovered. Usually aliases for properties of these resource types will be removed after the anomalous behavior is discovered. Issues of this nature will be documented here until final resolution.

All cases of known resource types with anomalous policy behavior are listed here. Currently there is no way to make these resource types invisible at policy authoring time, so writing policies that attempt to manage these resource types cannot be prevented, despite the fact that the results of such policies may be either incomplete or incorrect.

### Resource Type query results incomplete, missing, or non-standard format

In some cases, certain RPs may return incomplete or otherwise limited or missing information about resources of a given type. The Azure Policy engine is unable to determine the compliance of any resources of such a type. Below are listed the known resource types exhibiting this problem.

- Microsoft<span></span>.Web/sites/siteConfig
- Microsoft<span></span>.Web/sites/config/* (except Microsoft<span></span>.Web/sites/config/web)

Currently, there is no plan to change this behavior for the above Microsoft.Web resource types. If this scenario is important to you, please [open a support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) with the Web team.

- Microsoft.HDInsights/clusters/computeProfile.roles[*].scriptActions
- Microsoft.Sql/servers/auditingSettings
  - This type will work correctly as the related resource in `AuditIfNotExists` and `DeployIfNotExists` policies, as long as a `name` for the resource is provided, e.g:
  ```       "effect": "AuditIfNotExists",
            "details": {
              "type": "Microsoft.Sql/servers/auditingSettings",
              "name": "default"
            }
   ```
- Microsoft.DataLakeStore/accounts
  - This type behaves similarly to Microsoft.Sql/servers/autidintSettings. Compliance of some fields cannot be determined except in AuditIfNotExits and DeployIfNotExists.
- Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/instanceView

The potential for fixing these resource types is still under investigation.

### Resource Type not correctly published by resource provider

In some cases, a resource provider may implement a resource type, but not correctly publish it to the Azure Resource Manager. The result of this is that Azure Policy is unable to discover the type in order to determine compliance. In some cases, this still allows deny policies to work, but compliance results will usually be incorrect. These resource types exhibit this behavior:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices

These resource types previously exhibited this behavior, but are now removed:

- Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/networkRuleSet (replaced by Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/networkruleset**s**)
- Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/networkRuleSet (replaced by Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/networkruleset**s**)

In some cases the unpublished resource type is actually a subtype of a published type, which causes aliases to refer to a parent type instead of the unpublished type. Evaluation of such policies fails, causing the policy to never apply to any resource.

These resource types previously exhibited this behavior but have been fixed:

- Microsoft.EventHub/namespaces/networkrulesets
- Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/networkrulesets
- Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/backupShortTermRetentionPolicies
- Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/portalsettings/delegation

### Resource management that bypasses Azure Resource Manager

Resource providers are free to implement their own resource management operations outside of Azure Resource Manager ("dataplane" operations). In almost every Azure resource type, the distinction between resource management and dataplane operations is clear and the resource provider only implements resource management one way. Occasionally, a resource provider may choose to implement a type that can be managed both ways. In this case, Azure Policy controls the standard Azure Resource Manager API normally, but operations on the direct resource provider API to create, modify and delete resources of that type bypass Azure Resource Manager so they are invisible to Azure Policy. Since policy enforcement is incomplete, we recommend that customers do not implement policies targeting such a resource type. This is the list of known such resource types:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers

The storage team is working on implementing Azure Policy on its dataplane operations to address this scenario. This is expected to first be available in the middle of 2020.

Note that Azure policies for dataplane operations of certain targeted resource providers is also under active development.

 - Microsoft.Sql/servers/firewallRules

Firewall rules can be created/deleted/modified via T-SQL commands, which bypasses Azure Policy. There is currently no plan to address this.

- Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters/applications

Service Fabric applications created via direct requests to the Service Fabric cluster (i.e. via New-ServiceFabricApplication) will not appear in the Azure Resource Manager representation of the Service Fabric cluster. Policy will not be able to audit/enforce these applications.

### Nonstandard creation pattern

In a few instances, the creation pattern of a resource type doesn't follow normal REST patterns. In these cases, deny policies may not work or may only work for some properties. For example, certain resource types may PUT only a subset of the properties of the resource type to create the entire resource. With such types the resource could be created with a non-compliant value even though a deny policy exists to prevent it. A similar result may occur if a set of resource types can be created using a collection PUT. Known resource types that exhibit this class of behavior:

- Microsoft.Sql/servers/firewallRules
- Microsoft.Automation/certificates

There is currently no plan to change this behavior. If this scenario is important to you, please [open a support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) with the Azure SQL or Automation team.

### Provider pass-through to non Azure Resource Manager resources

There are examples where a resource provider publishes a resource type to Azure Resource Manager, but the resources it represents cannot be managed by Azure Resource Manager. For example, Microsoft.Web has published several resource types to Azure Resource Manager that actually represent resources of the customer's site rather than Azure Resource Manager resources. Such resources cannot or should not be managed by Azure policy, and are explicitly excluded. All known examples are listed here:

- Microsoft.Web/sites/deployments
- Microsoft.Web/sites/functions
- Microsoft.Web/sites/instances/deployments
- Microsoft.Web/sites/siteextensions
- Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/deployments
- Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/functions
- Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/instances/deployments
- Microsoft.Web/sites/slots/siteextensions

### Legacy or incorrect aliases

Since custom policies use aliases directly, it is usually not possible to update them without causing unintended side effects to existing custom policies. This means that aliases referring to incorrect information or following legacy naming conventions must be left in place, even though it may cause confusion. In certain cases where an alias is known to refer to the wrong information, another alias may be created as a corrected alternative to the known bad one. In these cases, the new alias will be given the name of the bad alias with .v2 appended. For example a bad alias named Microsoft.ResourceProvider/someType/someAlias would result in the addition of a corrected version named Microsoft.ResourceProvider/someType/someAlias.v2. If an alias is added to correct a .v2 alias it will be named by replacing v2 with v3. All known corrected aliases are listed here:

- Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/requestedServiceObjectiveName.v2

### Optional or auto-generated resource property that bypasses policy evaluation

In a few instances, when creating a resource from Azure Portal, the property is not set in the PUT request payload. When the request reaches the resource provider, the resource provider generates the property and sets the value. Because the property is not in the request payload, the policy cannot evaluate the property. Known resource fields that exhibit this class of behavior:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/networkAcls.defaultAction
- Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/principalType
- Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/storageProfile.osDisk.diskSizeGB
- Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachineProfile.storageProfile.osDisk.diskSizeGB
- Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/virtualMachines/storageProfile.osDisk.diskSizeGB

Using this type of alias in the existence condition of auditIfNotExists or deployIfNotExists policies works correctly. These two kinds of effects will get the full resource content to evaluate the existence condition. The property is always present in GET request payloads.

Using this type of alias in audit/deny/append effect policies works partially. The compliance scan result will be correct for existing resources. However, when creating/updating the resource, there will be no audit events for audit effect policies and no deny or append behaviors for deny/append effect policies because of the missing property in the request payload.
